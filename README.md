"It is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing
all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses
numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters insofar as
they are subject to reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and
geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be
carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus."
Gottfried Leibniz, Preface to the General Science, 1677
